        <p>
          Psychedelic Art was a graphic art form that created visual art
          inspired by the experience of psychedelic drugs and hallucinations.
          The art typically features vivid colors, curvilinear shapes and
          animations simulating psychedelic trips. These artworks featured an
          excessive use of colour to depict the inner distorted and surreal
          world of the psyche. This psychedelic art refers to creations from the
          late 60’s which would portray and simulate what it was like to take
          drugs, such as LSD, through visual representation for all. On this website, you will discover the major contributors to this movement, the origins and the main characteristics of 60's Psychedelic art.

              Wes Wilson is considered to be one of the most well-known American
              artists from the psychedelic art movement period for his posters.
              He is best known for creating the “psychedelic font” in 1966. This
              font consisted of making the letters look like they were melting
              and moving. He is referred to as the Father of Rock Posters. He was inspired by Art Nouveau and used his knowledge of promotional art to create his first psychedelic posters. Since then, he has had the honour of being titled the father of the rock poster.

              Victor Moscoso is a Spanish artist. He was a trained graphic
              designer that took elements from pop art and Art nouveau. He used
              the concept of radiating and vibrating colors. These colors were
              created by taking colors from the opposite end of the color wheel
              where each one had an equal value (dark to light) and intensity
              (brightness). This helped achieve the psychedelic effect that the
              drugs would create (or the ‘trip’). <br />

            The origins of Psychedelic Art relate back to the discovery of LSD
            by Albert Hofmann back in 1943. While studying the drug, he
            accidentally absorbed it and discovered its side effects. The
            developpement of psychedelic drugs helped artists realize their
            maximum creative potential and explore this new form of so called
            “trippy” art. The use of LSD was at its peak in the 60’s allowing
            the artists to visual represent hallucinatory experiences. <br />

            />
            Artworks using this Psychedelic aesthetic featured many key
            characteristics. The first big element is the use of intensely
            contrasting colors that had the ability to make the viewer’s eye
            light up after seeing the work. This is what makes the link to a
            mind-altering trip one gets of LSD obvious. The second major
            characteristic was the unique look of the melting lettering in
            motion. The last key element is the use of curve, curvilinear shapes
            and multicolored swirls which would create a kaleidoscopic effect.
            Juxtaposition of these shapes and lines was also important because
            it allowed the artists to create optical illusions.
